# Types of Guitars

## Acoustic Guitar
Acoustic guitar is the most well-known type of guitar. It doesn't require an amplifier and can amplify its volume with the big hole on it. The downside to using an acoustic guitar is its steel strings and its unchangeable tone, your hand will get accustomed to the steel strings over time but don't overdo it, your fingers will get a cut.

## Electric Acoustic
The Electric Acoustic is just the Acoustic guitar except this time you can plug it in the amplifier. It's what's used in stage by famous artists like Ed Sheeran. You can even use the pedal on it like other electric guitars.

## Classical Guitar
Some of you may think that the Classical guitar is an Acoustic but it's different, instead of steel strings it uses plastic or nylon and has a different Headstock and Pegs. It's has a different tune and one of my Favourite songs called Playing God by Polyphia is played on the Classical guitar but it may not look like it due to how Tim Henson's guitar is a prototype custom made for him. It's also the Guitar that's available on the Integrated Campus Ministry Office.

## Fender Telecaster
The Fender Telecaster is a type of guitar that's also made by Fender like the Stratocaster, like the three-pickup Stratocaster which followed it in 1954, the Telecaster is a versatile guitar and has been used in many genres, including country, reggae, rock, pop, folk, soul, blues, jazz, punk, metal, alternative, indie rock, and R&B. The only downside to the Telecaster is how far it's strings are from the fretboard and how heavy it is but compared to other guitars it's still a great choice.

## Les Paul
The Les Paul is a chunkier, heavier type of guitar than a Stratocaster. It's a type of Electric guitar that has a humbucker pickup tone that makes the tone sound like metal, distorted and rock. It's named after its creator, Les Paul was a Jazz songwriter and his guitar prototype served an inspiration for the most well known and best Les paul model out there, the Gibson Les Paul. One of the most famous people that's known to have used the Les Paul and even collaborated with Gibson for signature guitars was Slash.

## Fender Stratocaster
The Fender Stratocaster otherwise known as the Stratocaster is a type of Electric Guitar, it's known for its incredible versatility and for its iconic model that shaped the base and standard of electric guitars. It has 5 changebale tone types, built in volume and tone adjuster giving you more options. It's incredibly smooth to play on due to how close the strings are to the fret board and it feels great to glide over it. I recommend it if you're looking for your very first electric guitar. Unlike the telecaster or Lespaul it's lightweight so it's easy to carry around. I myself own one, its brand is Thomson, and the only guitar I own as of now.

# Amplifiers and Pedals

## Amplifier
The amplifier is essentially what amplifies your guitar volume, without it your electric guitar is useless, it's what gives it its tone, distortion, bass, and other things. You might as well get an acoustic guitar. Amplifiers have different settings wherein you can change your guitar's pickup like the low tone, mid tone, high tone, bass, gain, and volume. Though amplifiers have different settings and some have features that others don't, the only thing that is common with all of them is the fact that they will amplify your guitar's volume and set the tone for it.

## Pedals
Pedals are optional for playing the electric guitar but make it a whole lot better to play guitar. Pedals are simple devices that make it possible to add more tones to your guitar, it can make it sound like heavy metal, rock, jazz, etc. The Maximum Overdrive pedal is one of the most popular types of pedal and makes your guitar sound heavy metal, there is also the Distortion pedal that makes your guitar sound like rock (Some amplifiers have this feature on them). Having a pedal and needing a pedal requires two amplifier chords, a 9V battery, and an AC/DC Adapter but its polarity depends on the pedal itself.

## Learning the Guitar
If you have a guitar and amplifier or an acoustic guitar, you can visit the Ultimate Guitar Tabs or download the app on your phone, the site/app offers lessons on the guitar and tips. In the site/app, you can find Tabs of songs wherein it's as the music sheet notes, it's pretty self-explanatory, some song tabs are free but some are locked behind the paywall. This is where I started out learning the guitar by myself and still where I can find how to play songs I want to play. It also includes two types of tuner on the app.
